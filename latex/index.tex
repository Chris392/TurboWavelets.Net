\-Turbo\-Wavelets.\-Net provides very fast, flexible and compact implementations of discrete wavelet transformations in \-C\#. \-Unlike others this implementation has no limitation in sizes for the transformation (lengths like 39, 739,... are possible, not just power of two numbers) \-At the moment only floating point numbers are supported.\hypertarget{index_Features}{}\section{\-Features}\label{index_Features}

\item 1\-D biorthogonal 5/3 wavelet using the lifting scheme (for arbitrary sizes, not just power of 2)
\item 2\-D biorthogonal 5/3 wavelet using the lifting scheme (for arbitrary sizes, not just power of 2)
