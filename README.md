C# Implementation of a very fast and flexible and compact wavelet transformation.
# Features:
- 1D biorthogonal 5/3 wavelet (for arbitrary sizes, not just power of 2)
- 2D biorthogonal 5/3 wavelet (for arbitrary sizes, not just power of 2)
- 2D cascade sorting of coefficients  (for arbitrary sizes, not just power of 2)
- Scale/Crop coefficients in a defined grid
- apply a deadzone
- Multithreaded and threadsafe
